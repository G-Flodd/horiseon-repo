## Description 
My objecctive was to make the Horiseon website more accessible, Why? To aid the user and future devlopers by making the webiste easier and more user friendly. 

How have I done this? I first began to focus on the semantic HTML elements of the project, this included changing multiple divs to a more suited description, such as header or section. I then went on to add alt attributes to the sites images, these will be used to aid the visually impaired when utilising the website with screen readers.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage 

The website consists of a single page broken down in to an interactive header linking to a main section and side bar. 

The main section is comprised of three catogries all with a header and short description. 

Finaly there is the side bar, equally broken in to three sections.
