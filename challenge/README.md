Horiseon Project Update

Objective: To make the Horiseon website more accessible. 

I was asked to make the horiseon website more acesible. Why have I done this? To aid the user and future devlopers by making the webiste more accessible. 

How have I done this? I first began to focus on the semantic HTML elements of the project, This included changing multiple divs to a more suited description, such as header or section. I then went on to add alt attributed to the sites images, these will be used to aid the visually impaired whe utilising the website.
